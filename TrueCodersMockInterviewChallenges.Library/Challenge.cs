        //Challenge 1
        //Write a method called GenerateSequence that takes an int named n as parameters and returns an int array containing the numbers from 1 to n.
        //Example - int n = 5 your return value would be an array that looks like this [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        //Always assume n >= 0 if the input is 0, return an empty array


        //Challenge 2
        //Write a method named CountVowels that takes a string as a parameter and returns an int representing the number of vowels found within the string.
        //Vowels are considered to be (aeiou) NOT 'y', ignore case - 'A' and 'a' are both valid inputs
        //If there are not any vowels in the input string return 0


        //Challenge 3
        //Create a method named FindLargest that accepts an int array as parameters and returns an int representing the largest number.
        //Example - [3, 1, 10, 7, 6] you would return 10 since it is the largest number in the array
        //If the input array is empty return 0


        //Challenge 4
        //Write a method named FindOnesAndZeros that accepts an int array as a parameter and returns an int representing the count of the number of 1s AND 0s present in the array.
        //Any other value can be ignored.
        //Example - input [1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 3, 5] you would return 6 since there are 3 ones and 3 zeros
        //If the input array is empty return 0


        //Challenge 5        
        //Write a method named CountFalse that takes a bool array as parameters and returns an int that represents the number of times false appears
        //Example - [true, false, false] would return 2 since there are 2 false elements in the array
        //If the input array is empty return 0


        //Challenge 6
        //Write a method named BetweenTwoInts that takes two integers (a, b) as parameters and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.
        //Always assume a < b
        //Example a = -1, b = 3 you would return [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]


        //Challenge 7
        //Write a method named StringReverser that takes a string as parameters and returns the string but reversed.
        //Example - input = "Hello!" would return "!olleH"
        //If the input is null or an empty string just return an empty string.
